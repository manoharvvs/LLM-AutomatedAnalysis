# Dataset Analysis Narrative

## Overview

The dataset contains 2,363 entries with 11 key variables across multiple countries over various years. The metrics incorporate subjective well-being indicators, economic factors, social support components, and societal perceptions. Each entry relates to an individual country, covering years from 2005 to 2023, allowing for relatively recent trends in well-being and development to be analyzed.

## Missing Values

The analysis reveals notable missing values across several columns, which may impact the robustness of insights:

- **Log GDP per capita**: 28 missing entries
- **Social support**: 13 missing entries
- **Healthy life expectancy at birth**: 63 missing entries
- **Freedom to make life choices**: 36 missing entries
- **Generosity**: 81 missing entries
- **Perceptions of corruption**: 125 missing entries
- **Positive affect**: 24 missing entries
- **Negative affect**: 16 missing entries

Addressing these missing values through imputation or exclusion may be necessary before conducting any further analysis.

## Summary Statistics

The summary statistics highlight several key metrics:

- **Mean Life Ladder score**: 5.48 (on a scale of 1 to 10), indicating moderate levels of subjective well-being globally.
- **Mean Log GDP per capita**: 9.40, suggesting varying economic performance among countries.
- **Mean Social support level**: 0.81, which shows that most individuals in these countries feel a fair amount of social backing.
- **Healthy life expectancy at birth**: Average of 63.40 years signifies disparities in health standards.
  
The variations in the standard deviation across variables indicate some countries significantly diverge from the mean, especially in GDP and social support.

## Correlation Insights

The correlation matrix provides valuable insights into which factors are interrelated:

- **Life Ladder score strongly correlates with**:
  - **Log GDP per capita (r = 0.78)**: Suggesting that financial well-being has a significant impact on perceived happiness.
  - **Social support (r = 0.72)**: Indicating that individuals who feel supported tend to report higher life satisfaction.
  - **Healthy life expectancy (r = 0.71)**: Reflecting that health is closely linked to well-being perception.

- **Negative relationships**:
  - **Perceptions of corruption** have a strong negative correlation with the Life Ladder score (r = -0.43), suggesting higher corruption perceptions may negatively affect overall happiness.
  - **Negative affect** correlates positively with perceptions of corruption (r = 0.27), indicating higher perceived corruption could lead to increased negativity among individuals.

## Recommendations

1. **Data Cleaning**: Address the missing values through appropriate imputation techniques or consider excluding entries with excessive missing data to enhance analysis accuracy.
  
2. **Enhanced Analysis on Economic Variables**: Further delve into the relationship between economic indicators (such as GDP) and life satisfaction, considering regional variances in economic performance and its societal implications.

3. **Investigate Social Support Systems**: Conduct in-depth studies on the social support variables to identify patterns and develop strategies to improve these in countries with lower ratings.

4. **Address Corruption Perception**: Countries with high perception of corruption should investigate their underlying issues, as these are likely causing negative societal impacts that ultimately affect well-being.

5. **Promote Healthy Life Expectancy**: Since health is significantly associated with well-being, initiatives that promote health access, education, and socio-economic support should be prioritized.

6. **Yearly Trend Analysis**: Considering the dataset spans nearly two decades, time-series analysis could provide insights into how life satisfaction has evolved over time in relation to external factors.

By implementing these recommendations, policymakers could better navigate the complexities of societal well-being and economic prosperity, fostering environments where individuals can thrive.
